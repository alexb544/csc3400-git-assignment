Created conflicts between the two repositories by changing the names of the functions in calculator.py. One made them longer (i.e. addition, subtraction, etc.), and the other shortened them (i.e. add, sub, mult, etc.) 



When I received the error to resolve the conflict I opened the calculator.py file in VS Code and accepted the incoming changes, which were the shorter named functions.
